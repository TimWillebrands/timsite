This is a stub I will expand.

- Context: Before Auxin, I architected an in-house platform that could host modern React apps while embedding parts of the legacy system during a safe transition.
- Requirement from the client: a central hub for horticulture, enabling third parties to expose their own apps.
- Strategy: every app is a single service + its own database + its own webapp. No shared mutable data, total isolation. Inspired by microservices, but intentionally independent monoliths presented through a shared platform.
- Platform responsibilities: authentication, multi-tenancy, navigation, and style cohesion. App responsibilities: everything else.

Iâ€™ll flesh this out with diagrams, trade-offs, and rollout notes.
