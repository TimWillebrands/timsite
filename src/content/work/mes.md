## The Problem
Manual migration was error-prone and too slow for timeline and scale.

## My Role & The Insight
Led migration engineering; automation with idempotent steps reduces risk and cycle time.

## The Technical Solution
Streaming ETL with validation gates, observability, and retryable jobs.

## The Impact
Cut migration time and reduced defects while enabling safe re-runs.
