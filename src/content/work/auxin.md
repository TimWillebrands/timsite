## The Problem
Complex domain surfaces across services created fragmentation and duplication for client teams.

## My Role & The Insight
Led architecture and implementation; unified schemas behind a single contract while preserving team autonomy.

## The Technical Solution
Apollo Federation with schema composition, auth directives, cache hints, and observability baked in.

## The Impact
Reduced client integration time and enabled independent service evolution.
